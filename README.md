Stock Database Project


stage3_pretty.py is my final design; has a much better UI and process for obtaining and updating stock info is much quicker

stage3 works and is fully functional but the UI is very basic and the fetch function can be very slow


templates.zip contains all the html files for stage3_pretty.py, place templates file in root of main script


the correct dataframe is sp500Test_info_df, but should be able to get iwth update function in app
